## Breaking Changes
- 4cfa67f04adbe4244cfa67f04adbe4244cfa67f0 feat!: the course of true love never did run smooth

  Lord, what fools these mortals be! The lunatic, the lover and the poet are of
  imagination all compact.
## New Features

  And all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their
  entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts.
- 70204b7eaa8fbf4070204b7eaa8fbf4070204b7e feat: to be or not to be
## Bug Fixes
- fd0ff5c9d7cd4bf9fd0ff5c9d7cd4bf9fd0ff5c9 fix: though she be but little, she is fierce

  Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust
  upon them.
## Dependency Updates
