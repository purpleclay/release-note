- 02b437dcc3be9b7b02b437dcc3be9b7b02b437dc comprehensive guide to staging Hamlet

  This production combines the traditional elements of Elizabethan theatre with modern interpretations:

  Principal considerations:
  - The soliloquies must be delivered with proper contemplation and pause for dramatic effect
  - Staging of the ghost requires atmospheric lighting and ethereal movement across the stage
  - Sword choreography in the final duel demands precision and theatrical flourish

  Performance notes:

  1. Hamlet's madness should transition from feigned to genuine throughout the five acts
  2. Ophelia's descent into madness must contrast with Hamlet's calculated performance
  3. The play-within-a-play scene requires careful direction to maintain audience attention

  Stage directions example:

  ```
  [Ghost beckons HAMLET to follow. Exeunt GHOST and HAMLET]
  HORATIO: He waxes desperate with imagination.
  ```

  > Note: The text of the First Folio differs significantly from the Second Quarto and should be consulted for alternate readings.

  Additional context on Elizabethan staging conventions is essential for authentic production.
