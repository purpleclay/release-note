- 1802980fdd17481c1802980fdd17481c1802980f add wisdom from the bard

  From the great playwright's most celebrated work on the nature of existence:

  > To be, or not to be, that is the question—whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them.

  This soliloquy explores the fundamental nature of human existence and mortality.
