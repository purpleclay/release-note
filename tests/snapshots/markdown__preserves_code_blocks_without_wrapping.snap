[**`1`**](#new-features) new feature

## New Features
- **`e313b4f`** add theatrical script formatting

  The script format preserves the playwright's original line formatting without alteration:

  ```
  HAMLET: To be, or not to be, that is the question—whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles
  OPHELIA: Good my lord, how does your honour for this many a day?
  ```

  These lines must maintain their integrity as written by the immortal bard.
