- e2e946a0ecd5da56e2e946a0ecd5da56e2e946a0 feat: the ill-fated star-crossed lovers

  In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, the never-ending blood-feud between
  two well-respected households breaks into new mutiny. The star-crossed lovers,
  fortune-favoured in their passion yet ill-fated in their destiny, take their
  life. Their death-marked love and parents' rage could naught but with their
  children's end bury their strife.
