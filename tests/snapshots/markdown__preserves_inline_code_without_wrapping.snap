- 82155fff37617dcd82155fff37617dcd82155fff feat: preserve formatting in dramatic text

  When Hamlet ponders mortality, he invokes `toBeOrNotToBeThatIsTheQuestion`
  near the line boundary. Similarly, the method
  `whetherTisNoblerInTheMindToSufferTheSlingsAndArrows` tests wrapping. Call
  `theSeaOfTroubles` for reference.
