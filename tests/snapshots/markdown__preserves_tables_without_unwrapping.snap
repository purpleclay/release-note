- 23819342d23062db23819342d23062db23819342 feat: add comparison of Shakespeare's great tragedies

  This feature adds a comprehensive overview of the four great tragedies, allowing users to compare key elements across these masterworks of Elizabethan drama.

  | Play     | Year | Protagonist | Fatal Flaw       |
  |----------|------|-------------|------------------|
  | Hamlet   | 1601 | Hamlet      | Indecision       |
  | Othello  | 1604 | Othello     | Jealousy         |
  | King Lear| 1606 | Lear        | Vanity           |
  | Macbeth  | 1606 | Macbeth     | Ambition         |

  Each tragedy explores the downfall of a noble figure through their own weaknesses, reflecting the Aristotelian concept of hamartia that Shakespeare so masterfully employed.
