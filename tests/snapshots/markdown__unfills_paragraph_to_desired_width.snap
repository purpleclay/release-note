- 9d41608a39c39a549d41608a39c39a549d41608a feat: add the quality of mercy soliloquy

  The quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
  upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed: it blesseth him that gives and him
  that takes.

  'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes the throned monarch better than
  his crown. His scepter shows the force of temporal power, the attribute to awe
  and majesty.
