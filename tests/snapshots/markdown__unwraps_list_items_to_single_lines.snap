## New Features
- **`d662116`** the seven ages of man

  All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages:

  - The infant, mewling and puking in the nurse's arms, knowing naught of the world that awaits
  - The whining school-boy with his satchel and shining morning face, creeping like snail unwillingly to school
  - The lover, sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad made to his mistress' eyebrow
  - The soldier, full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard, jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel
  - The justice, in fair round belly with good capon lined, with eyes severe and beard of formal cut

  That is the last scene of all, that ends this strange eventful history.
