- eb409319eb0ce5d0eb409319eb0ce5d0eb409319 feat: instructions for wooing fair maidens

  When wooing a lady of quality, attend to these principles with utmost care and devotion:

  1. First, compose sonnets praising her beauty in terms most eloquent, comparing her eyes to stars and her voice to sweetest music
  2. Second, present tokens of affection such as posies of flowers gathered from the fairest gardens in the realm
  3. Third, demonstrate thy valour and honour through noble deeds that shall be sung by minstrels across the land
