[**`1`**](#new-features) new feature

## New Features
- **`9d41608`** add the quality of mercy soliloquy

  The quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed: it blesseth him that gives and him that takes.

  'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown. His scepter shows the force of temporal power, the attribute to awe and majesty.
